# Context as a First-Class Axis

Context in SPEL is not metadata.
It is a semantic axis that participates in canonicalization.

Rules:
- Context is explicit.
- Context participates in κ.
- Two encodings with identical structure but different context are NOT equivalent.
- Context boundaries are immutable once declared.
